Program that computes Fibonacci numbers based on command-line arguments given by the user.

Instructions:

Simply enter the 'nth' Fibonacci number you wish to calculate as a command-line argument, and the result will be printed to the console. 

- Any non-integer values will be thrown as exceptions and handled as errors. 
- Any negative integers will be handled as errors (exception will not be thrown since negative integers will still allow program to compile and run).
- Program only calculates Fibonacci number for the first argument.
